SafeNet is a production-grade Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA) framework specifically engineered for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environments. By orchestrating a secure, identity-aware VPN overlay utilizing the **WireGuard** protocol, SafeNet provides granular control over network access through dynamic peer synchronization and strict **/32 CIDR microsegmentation**. The framework ensures a high-security perimeter via ephemeral cryptographic key management and a modern asynchronous control plane.

## Core Architecture

SafeNet implements a rigid **Hub-and-Spoke** topology where the central gateway acts as the authoritative Control Plane. Lateral movement is mathematically restricted through the enforcement of **/32 CIDR masks** for every connected peer, ensuring that devices remain isolated within the overlay unless explicit routing policies are defined.

> **Note on Microsegmentation**: By assigning unique /32 addresses and managing the AllowedIPs table dynamically, SafeNet prevents unauthorized east-west traffic between peers at the kernel level.

## Key Features

*   **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure, token-based access control for all management operations.
*   **Automated Network Orchestration**: Programmatic management of Windows WireGuard services and interfaces.
*   **Dynamic Peer Synchronization**: Real-time updates to the WireGuard configuration without tunnel interruption.
*   **Cryptokey Routing**: Verified public-key identity binding for every network packet.
*   **Zero-Disk-Key Policy**: Ephemeral server keys are managed in memory and cleared upon service termination.

## Comprehensive Setup Guide

### Method 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

SafeNet provides automated batch scripts to handle environment preparation and gateway ignition.

1.  **Initialize Environment**: Double-click `setup_env.bat`. This script verifies the Python installation, creates a local virtual environment, and installs all required dependencies.
2.  **Launch Gateway**: Right-click `run_server.bat` and select **Run as Administrator**. This elevates the process to allow the FastAPI backend to interface with the Windows kernel and WireGuard driver.

### Method 2: Manual Deployment (Advanced)

For developers requiring granular control over the initialization sequence:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure [WireGuard for Windows](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) is installed and added to the System PATH.
2.  **Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Launch Server**:
    Open an **Elevated Command Prompt (Administrator)** and execute:
    ```bash
    python run_api.py
    ```

## CLI Administration Dashboard

The administrative interface allows for rapid enrollment and status monitoring of the security perimeter.

```bash
# Verify system and interface status
python cli/console.py status

# Activate the WireGuard tunnel service
python cli/console.py start

# Enroll a new device and generate a /32 configuration
python cli/console.py enroll new-device-name
```
